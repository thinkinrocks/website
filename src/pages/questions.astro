            Join our Telegram community first, then attend one of our meetups or workshops. We provide training and access 
            to community members who are working on interesting projects. Equipment usage is based on availability and project requirements.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-mono mb-2 text-gray-900">What kind of projects can I work on?</h3>
          <p class="font-sans text-gray-700">
            We support a wide range of projects including AI/ML research, robotics development, computer vision, 
            hardware prototyping, and educational initiatives. Priority is given to open-source projects and those 
            that benefit the broader community.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-mono mb-2 text-gray-900">Is there a cost to use the equipment?</h3>
          <p class="font-sans text-gray-700">
            We operate as a community-driven lab. While basic access is free for community members, 
            we may ask for contributions to cover maintenance costs for intensive usage or longer-term projects. 
            Contact us to discuss your specific needs.
