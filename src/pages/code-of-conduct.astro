        <p>
          At Thinkin' Rocks, we believe innovation happens best in an environment of respect, safety, and fairness. All community sessions and hardware use follow this Code of Conduct. By joining, you agree to these rules.
        </p>
        
        <p class="font-mono text-base">Behaviour We Don't Tolerate</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 text-base">
          <li>Verbal or written disrespect towards any participant or organiser</li>
          <li>Intimidation, harassment, or threats of any kind</li>
          <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>

        <p>
          <strong>Reservation required:</strong> All tools and hardware must be booked in advance through our system. Please respect time slots so everyone has fair access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Care & responsibility:</strong> Treat all shared equipment as if it were your own. Misuse or damage through negligence may result in suspension of access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your IP is yours:</strong> Anything you build, code, or design at Thinkin' Rocks belongs to you (and your collaborators, if agreed). Thinkin' Rocks does not claim ownership of members' work.
